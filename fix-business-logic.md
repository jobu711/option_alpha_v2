## Task
- Deep Analysis of the core pipeline business logic.  

## Problem Statement
- Options Scans are returning every setup as neutral, even when some of them seem bullish.

## Context
- Extract complex logic into separate functions
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Recommend data structures that better fit the use case
- Analyze this Python code for bugs and logic errors
- Review this Python function for performance bottlenecks. Identify:
- Time complexity issues
- Memory inefficiencies  
- Unnecessary operations or redundant logic
- Better algorithmic approaches
- Provide optimized version with explanations

### Comprehensive Error Analysis
"Perform a thorough error analysis of this Python code. Check for:
- Syntax errors and typos
- Type mismatches and incorrect variable usage
- Exception handling gaps
- Edge cases that could cause runtime errors
- Potential security vulnerabilities (SQL injection, path traversal, etc.)
- Import and dependency issues
- check for redudant logic, unused variables, code duplication
