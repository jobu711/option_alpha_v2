# Task: Run full test suite and fix regressions

## Description
Run the complete test suite (`pytest tests/`) to verify no regressions from the discovery feature. Fix any failures. This is the final validation gate before the epic can be marked complete.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] `pytest tests/` passes with 0 failures
- [ ] New `tests/test_discovery.py` tests all pass
- [ ] No existing tests broken by config.py, orchestrator.py, or universe_routes.py changes
- [ ] Any regressions identified and fixed

## Technical Details

### Commands
```bash
pytest tests/ -v
pytest tests/test_discovery.py -v
```

### Common regression risks
- `config.py` changes: existing tests that create `Settings()` should still work (new fields have defaults)
- `orchestrator.py` changes: mocked tests may need the `universe_tickers` table in their test DB
- `universe_routes.py` changes: new imports could fail if discovery module has import-time errors

### Files affected
- Any files that need regression fixes (determined at runtime)

## Dependencies
- [ ] All other tasks (108-113) must be complete

## Effort Estimate
- Size: S
- Hours: 1
- Parallel: false (final gate)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Full test suite passes
- [ ] No regressions
- [ ] Epic ready for completion
