# Task: Web dashboard - core views

## Description
Build the FastAPI web application with Jinja2 templates and HTMX interactivity. Includes the main dashboard with scan trigger button, WebSocket-based real-time progress display, ranked candidates table (sortable, color-coded by direction), ticker detail panel with full score breakdown/options/Greeks/AI debate, and market regime header showing VIX and SPY trend.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] `web/app.py` FastAPI app factory with Jinja2 template configuration and static file serving
- [ ] `web/routes.py` route handlers: GET / (dashboard), GET /ticker/{symbol} (detail), POST /scan (trigger)
- [ ] `web/websocket.py` WebSocket endpoint for real-time scan progress updates
- [ ] Dashboard page: scan trigger button, progress bar (HTMX + WebSocket), last scan timestamp
- [ ] Ranked candidates table: sortable columns (ticker, composite score, direction, catalyst date, conviction)
- [ ] Color coding: green rows for bullish, red for bearish, yellow for neutral
- [ ] Top 10 candidates visually highlighted
- [ ] Ticker detail panel: score breakdown table (indicator, raw, normalized, weight, contribution)
- [ ] Ticker detail: options recommendation (strike, expiry, direction, delta, gamma, theta, vega)
- [ ] Ticker detail: AI debate section (Bull thesis, Bear counter, Risk synthesis, conviction badge)
- [ ] Market regime header: VIX level, SPY trend indicator
- [ ] Score history chart per ticker (from SQLite historical data)
- [ ] Responsive layout with clean styling (CSS, no framework required)

## Technical Details
- FastAPI with `Jinja2Templates` and `StaticFiles` mount
- HTMX for: scan trigger (`hx-post`), table sorting (`hx-get` with query params), ticker detail loading (`hx-get` swap)
- WebSocket: FastAPI `WebSocket` endpoint, progress JSON messages, auto-reconnect JS
- Alpine.js for minor client-side interactivity (dropdowns, modals)
- Templates: `base.html`, `dashboard.html`, `ticker_detail.html`, `_candidates_table.html` (HTMX partial)
- Color coding via CSS classes: `.bullish { background: green-tint }`, `.bearish { red-tint }`, `.neutral { yellow-tint }`
- VIX/SPY data: fetch via yfinance on dashboard load (cached)
- Score history: simple line chart via lightweight JS library or SVG

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 005 (persistence layer for reading scan results)
- [ ] Task 006 (pipeline orchestrator for triggering scans)

## Effort Estimate
- Size: XL
- Hours: 12-16
- Parallel: false

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented
- [ ] Templates render correctly
- [ ] Scan trigger and progress display working
- [ ] All views display data from persistence layer
