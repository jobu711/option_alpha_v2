# Task: Run full test suite and verify no regressions

## Description
Run the complete test suite to confirm all changes work together with no regressions. This is the final validation gate before the epic can be marked complete.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] `pytest tests/ -v` passes with 0 failures
- [ ] No new warnings related to the changed code
- [ ] Config default verified: `Settings().max_bid_ask_spread_pct == 0.30`
- [ ] Ollama prompt hint verified: no schema metadata in structured output path

## Technical Details
- Run: `pytest tests/ -v`
- Verify total test count matches or exceeds previous count (547+)
- Spot-check key tests:
  - `tests/test_ai.py::TestOllamaClientRequest::test_complete_structured_output`
  - `tests/test_chains.py` (options filtering)
  - `tests/test_earnings.py` (catalysts)

## Dependencies
- [ ] Tasks 30, 31, 32 must all be complete

## Effort Estimate
- Size: XS
- Hours: 0.1
- Parallel: false (final gate)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Full suite passes
- [ ] No regressions confirmed
