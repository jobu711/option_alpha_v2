# Task: Add universe OI settings to config

## Description
Add two new settings to the `Settings` class in `config.py` for universe open interest filtering and scheduled refresh. These settings are consumed by later tasks.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] `min_universe_oi: int = 100` added to Settings class in the "Universe filtering" section
- [ ] `universe_refresh_schedule: str = "sat"` added to Settings class in the "Universe filtering" section
- [ ] Settings serialize/deserialize correctly via `save()` and `load()`
- [ ] Existing tests pass without modification

## Technical Details
- File: `src/option_alpha/config.py`
- Add both fields in the "Universe filtering" section (after line 77, near `universe_refresh_interval_days`)
- `min_universe_oi` controls the minimum total open interest threshold for stock tickers to be included in the universe
- `universe_refresh_schedule` controls which day of week the scheduled refresh runs (used by APScheduler in Task 5)
- Both use simple defaults, no complex validation needed

## Dependencies
- [ ] None — this is the foundational task

## Effort Estimate
- Size: XS
- Hours: 1
- Parallel: false (other tasks depend on these settings)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented
- [ ] Existing tests pass (`pytest tests/`)
- [ ] Settings round-trip through save/load correctly
