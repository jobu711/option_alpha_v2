# Task: Remove delisted tickers from universe.py

## Description
Remove ~20 confirmed delisted, acquired, merged, or invalid tickers from the SP500_CORE and POPULAR_OPTIONS lists in `src/option_alpha/data/universe.py`. Fix the duplicate RIVN entry in POPULAR_OPTIONS.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] ~12 delisted tickers removed from SP500_CORE

- [ ] Duplicate RIVN entry in POPULAR_OPTIONS fixed
- [ ] No valid/active tickers accidentally removed
- [ ] All existing tests pass

## Technical Details
- File: `src/option_alpha/data/universe.py`
- Pure list edits — no logic changes
- Verify each ticker is actually delisted/invalid before removing (check yfinance or public sources)
- Universe size should drop from ~702 to ~682

## Dependencies
- [ ] None — fully independent task

## Effort Estimate
- Size: S
- Hours: 1-2
- Parallel: true (no dependencies on other tasks)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented
- [ ] Tests written and passing
- [ ] Existing 547+ tests still pass
