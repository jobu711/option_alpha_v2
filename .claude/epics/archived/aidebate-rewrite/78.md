# Task: Add SDK dependencies

## Description

Update `pyproject.toml` to add `anthropic` and `ollama` Python SDKs as dependencies. Remove the unused `instructor` dependency. Reinstall the package to verify dependency resolution.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `anthropic>=0.39.0` added to core dependencies in pyproject.toml
- [ ] `ollama>=0.4.0` added to core dependencies in pyproject.toml
- [ ] `instructor>=0.4.0` removed from core dependencies
- [ ] `pip install -e ".[all,dev]"` completes without errors
- [ ] `python -c "import anthropic; import ollama"` succeeds

## Technical Details

- **File**: `pyproject.toml`
- Add both SDKs to the `dependencies` list (core, not optional) since AI debate is a core feature
- Remove `instructor` — it was imported with a try/except in clients.py but never actually used for structured output
- Keep `httpx` — it's used by other parts of the codebase (data fetcher, universe refresh)
- Both SDKs depend on httpx internally, so no version conflict expected

## Dependencies

- [ ] None — this is the first task

## Effort Estimate

- Size: XS
- Hours: 0.5
- Parallel: false (must complete before tasks 79-81)

## Definition of Done

- [ ] pyproject.toml updated
- [ ] Package reinstalled successfully
- [ ] SDK imports verified
