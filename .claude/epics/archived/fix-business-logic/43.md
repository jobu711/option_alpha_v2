# Task: Add skip-reason logging to options recommender

## Description
The options recommender silently skips tickers (neutral direction, no liquid contracts, no delta match) with only debug-level logs. Upgrade key skip messages to info level and add a direction distribution summary so operators can quickly see why recommendations are low.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] `recommend_contract()` logs at info level when skipping neutral tickers: "Skipping AAPL: NEUTRAL direction (no options recommendation)"
- [ ] `recommend_contract()` logs at info level for empty liquidity filter: "Skipping AAPL: no liquid call contracts (OI>=100, spread<=30%)"
- [ ] `recommend_for_scored_tickers()` logs direction distribution of input: "Options input: 15 BULLISH, 8 BEARISH, 27 NEUTRAL out of 50 tickers"
- [ ] All existing tests pass

## Technical Details
- **recommender.py** (line 256): Change `logger.debug` to `logger.info` for neutral skip
- **recommender.py** (line 271): Change `logger.debug` to `logger.info` for empty liquidity filter
- **recommender.py** (`recommend_for_scored_tickers()`, ~line 377): Add direction distribution counter before the loop:
  ```python
  from collections import Counter
  dir_counts = Counter(ts.direction.value for ts in ticker_scores)
  logger.info("Options input: %s", ", ".join(f"{c} {d}" for d, c in dir_counts.items()))
  ```

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 42 (basic pipeline fix should be in place)

## Effort Estimate
- Size: XS
- Hours: 0.5
- Parallel: true (independent of Tasks 2, 3, 4, 6)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Skip reasons visible at info log level
- [ ] Direction distribution logged before options processing
- [ ] All existing tests pass
